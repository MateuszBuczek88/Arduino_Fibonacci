# Arduino Fibonacci Project



## About

Project, made out of Arduino UNO, IR diode, IR remote, OLED 128pix display. IR
Arduino Remote signal is captured by IR Recive Diode, than interpreted and translated to integers
from 0-9 range. Interpreted number is used as argument of recursive Fibonacci method.
This method returns revelant element from Fibonacci sequence. Than result is shown on
the OLED display.
